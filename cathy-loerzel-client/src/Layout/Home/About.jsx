        Hi! I’m Cathy. I am a military brat, a self diagnosed 3 on the enneagram, 
        a mother of 5 and 7 year old boys, and a wife to a mountaineer/farmer/therapist. 
        I love dogs and I come alive around water... lakes, oceans, rivers, creeks, swamps - 
        you name it - I love it. My dream is to be able to have a house where I can drink 
        coffee every morning looking at water.

      <p className="about-text">
        I received my MACP in Psychology in 2007 and founded The Allender Center with Dan 
        Allender in 2010. I have spent the last decade helping to create the Trauma Informed 
        Narrative Therapy methodology, design the Allender Center programs, concretize our 
        group theory, facilitate and teach. This past year, Dan and I wrote <strong>
          Redeeming Heartache</strong> and it was a joy to create. (You should buy it)

        Aside from that, I am passionate about cooking, decorating, hosting parties and 
        nagging my family about keeping the house clean. I’m also generally astonished by my family
        &#x27;s capacity to wreak havoc on a clean house and I’m bound and determined to raise 
        boys who clean up after themselves.  We are all a work in progress.
